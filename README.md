# Abstract
The process related to an insurance claim following a car accident can take up to multiple weeks and require multiple interaction with different stakeholders. Developments in Deep Learning represent an opportunity for speeding up the process while increasing the efficiency. In this paper, I propose a solution using Convolutional Neural Network to automatize the classification of car damages for insurances. Three different classification tasks are defined, based on a workflow defined in the paper, a dedicated module is built for each task. Each module consists in a single classification model trained on dedicated dataset. The following tasks are focused on: the classification of whether a car is damaged or not, the localization of the damages, and their severity. Transfer learning is used to build each module, in order to determine the optimal network architecture, a selection of pre-trained models is compared (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50V2, EfficientNet-B0). The best performing model is EfficientNet-B0, which is then re-trained and fine-tuned. It yields a validation accuracy of 94% for the classification of whether a car is damaged or not, 76% for the localization of the damages, and 73% for damage severity. The EfficientNet family is lighter, faster, and gives a lot of room for improvement, thanks to the family of modelâ€™s variation. Better results could be obtained with a larger dataset of higher quality, through a dynamic tuning of the model learning rate. The workflow currently used is not sufficiently developed for live application; however, it gives a direction for further research with a focus on cost estimation and part detection as part of an insurance claim process.
